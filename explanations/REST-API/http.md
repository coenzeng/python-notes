# HTTP 
HTTP is a method computers use to request and send information. It stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It allows for the web browser to fetch resources, like HTML + CSS pages. It is a client-side protocol, meaning requests are initiated by the user (browser), never the server. For example, when someone goes to coenzeng.com, their web broswer sends an HTTP request for information from the server for the content to appear on the page. The servers will then send all the HTML, CSS, image files and more which the browser will display to the user.

HTTP is stateless. Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. When the client makes an HTTP request, it includes all information necessary for the server to fulfill that request. The server never relies on information from previous requests.

HTTP is not sessionless however. If a user is on an ecommerce store and wants to use the shopping cart, HTTP cookies can be used to allow different pages to share the same state.
